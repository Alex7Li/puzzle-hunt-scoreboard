HACKING THE SITE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO ANY PUZZLE 
I have tried to do some security things so it shouldn't be easy.
If you see a security vulnerability that would expose all of the
passwords, please report it instead of solving every clue that
requires a password.

Other than trying to find the database with all of the passwords,
you can still try and run around with inspect element all you want.
In a previous contest, it would have helped you find a hidden link.
